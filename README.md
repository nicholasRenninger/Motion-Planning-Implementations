# Motion-Planning-Projects
A repo containing all of my motion planning algorithm projects.


## [bugAlgorithms_and_kinematics](https://github.com/nicholasRenninger/bugAlgorithms_and_kinematics)

This repo contains implementations of Bug Algorithms and a Forwards / Inverse Kinematics solver for a 3-link manipulator. Results of the implentation include:

* plots of the path performance of the different **bug planning algorithms** on multiple environments
* plots of the results of running **forwards / inverse kinematics on a user specified 2-link manipulator**


## [cSpaceViz_Gradient_Wavefront_planners](https://github.com/nicholasRenninger/cSpaceViz_Gradient_Wavefront_planners)

Implementation of a 2-D 2DoF manipulator configuration space visualizer, as well as implementations of a gradient descent and wavefront planner for this manipulator. 

Results of the implentation include:

* **C-Space visualizer for a translating, rotating robot and obstacle** of the same polygonal shape
* **Gradient descent planner** path visualization for a point robot in multiple enviroments, including those from the [bugAlgorithms_and_kinematics](https://github.com/nicholasRenninger/bugAlgorithms_and_kinematics) repo.
* **Wavefront planner** path visualization for a point robot in multiple enviroments, including those from the [bugAlgorithms_and_kinematics](https://github.com/nicholasRenninger/bugAlgorithms_and_kinematics) repo.
* **C-Space visualizer for a 2-link manipulator** with arbitrary polygonal obstacles
* **Wavefront planner** workspace path for the 2-link manipulator
